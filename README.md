# Task-Manager

## Description

* This is a more comprehensive task manager which can be used for keeping track of various users and tasks for a small business or non-profit organisation. 

*This task manager allows a user to:
 * Register employees (Admin user only can do this)
 * Keep track of who is registered as an employee
 * Create and store all the employee usernames and passwords (in .txt file)
 * Keep track of which employee is doing what task, and whether that task has been completed or not
 * The relevant start and end dates of that task (if completed)
 * View basic statistics of the tasks and employees 
 * Generate .txt file reports of the current situation of task delegation

## What/who the project is for:

* This program can be used by any small business owner (or non profit institution owned) who would like to keep track of the employees and their relevant tasks at any given time. 

## How the project works:

* Users for the program can add tasks, view all tasks, view all personal tasks, and view statistics of the business.
* The "Admin" user however has all the above options but also has one more. **Only the "Admin" user is allowed to add/register new users. Once the user has been registered (ie stored in a text file), they will be able to log on themselves.** 
* They are able to register and store their staff members in a .txt file after which the employee can then log on and change their personal information if they would like to ( eg: change their password, mark one of their tasks as complete, etc).
* Once registered and logged in, users are able to change their task dates, password, username, etc.


## Goal of the project:

* This program is to assist a small organisation/business with basic tasks within their business. The goal here is to provide a simple and straightforward platform for the average user to still be able to maintain a digital tracking of their business.
